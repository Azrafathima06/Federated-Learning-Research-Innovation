# Non-IID Simulation

## Client Formation (10 clients)
Client Split Rules:
- Attack-skewed: Clients 1-4 (90% attacks)
- Benign-skewed: Clients 5-7 (90% benign)  
- Balanced: Clients 8-10 (50/50)
| Client Group  | Benign% | Attack% |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Attack-skewed | 10%     | 90%     |
| Benign-skewed | 90%     | 10%     |
| Balanced      | 50%     | 50%     |
